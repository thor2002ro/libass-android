     * When the target frame size exceeds this limit, the render size will be

     *
     * This reduces CPU and memory usage on high-resolution displays (e.g., 4K TVs)
     * at the cost of slightly lower subtitle sharpness.
     *
     * Examples:
     * - 1920 * 1080 = 2_073_600 (limit to 1080p)
     * - 2560 * 1440 = 3_686_400 (limit to 1440p)
     * - 0 = no limit, render at full frame size (default)
     *
     * Only applies to OVERLAY and EFFECTS render types. CUES mode is not affected.
